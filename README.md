# What's the purpose of this package? ü§î

This package helps you to categorize messages into four types as follows: `danger`, `warning`, `success` and `normal`.

You can set ***Flash Messages*** and retrieve them along with automatic deletion.

# How to install üòÉ

**Initially, you need to have the *[composer](https://composer.org)* installed.**

To install this package, follow the command:

```
composer require am-mokhtari/alert-manager
```

# How to use üòµ

## The functions in use, follow as below:

- Alert::addNormal(string $message, bool $isFlash)
- Alert::addSuccess(string $message, bool $isFlash)
- Alert::addWarning(string $message, bool $isFlash)
- Alert::addDanger(string $message, bool $isFlash)

This kind of functions is applicable to both regular `alerts` and `flash messages`.
